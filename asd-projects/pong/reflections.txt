User Story/Gameplay:
Two paddles will move vertically as a ball comes towards them; the goal is to prevent the ball from passing the paddles and hitting the wall behind the paddles.
When the game begins, the two paddles are at the center of the screen and the ball is in the center, moving towards one of the paddles.
The game should end when one player reaches a certain number of points.
